            <p>The current scale and rate of economic change in Peru together with concurrent rates of habitat loss, resource depletion, and degraded ecosystem services combined with ongoing climate change make this environmental physics study very timely. Additionally, dependence on critical natural resources and systems that are increasingly impacted by indiscriminate and uncontrolled resource exploitation, make the proposed collaborative endeavour both necessary and appropriate, as it addresses both environmental change and the need for new approaches while offering support for the development of research capability in the region of Huanta.
              <br><br>
              In water-stressed regions, the efficient functioning of natural systems is vital for resource management, conservation, and development. The direct and indirect impacts of agricultural and industrial development in arid regions, especially in upland mountainous regions, are known to be longer lasting than those in humid environments. The upland Andean environments are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of both resource exploitation and climate change. Peru is South America's most water stressed country with over 70% of its inhabitants living in arid coastal and intermontane regions, where the absolute scarcity of water is the natural state. The geographical focus is on the arid and semi-arid intermontane valley networks throughout the Andes. Rivers flowing from high Andean ridges of the continental divide, into the Amazon basin and the Pacific coast, support considerable areas of agriculture and urban populations as they descend. The headwater areas of many river catchments in the Andes are where the majority of Peru's mining industry is located. In central and southern Peru the mining sector dominates economic decision-making as it dominates national economic planning. It is precisely the headwater areas where water flow and the control of water quality throughout the Andes is so critical. The mining sector, while essential to the national economy is highly controversial in its widespread impact on water resources for the entire country. That is, through water abstraction for mineral processing and contamination through acid mine drainage. Throughout the Andes, rivers are channelled through extensive irrigation systems to supply traditional agriculture and newly irigated areas to produce crops for increasing indigenous demand and growing export markets. In the upper Rio Mantaro drainage basin, particularly in the arid intennontane valleys in the department of Ayacucho, environmental limits to agricultural development are exacerbated by the use and misuse of land resources. This likely includes the use of pesticides and fertilizers which variably impacts the environmental systems while climatic change is likely to affect rainfall patterns.
              <br><br>
              The development of rapid and accurate methods and technologies for environmental monitoring and impact analysis is now a global priority. This presents a complex challenge in the highly diverse environments of Peru where altitude ranges from sea level to 5000m, temperature can range from -20C to 48C, and much of the country is remote and inaccessible. It is in this context that the University of Cambridge has started a program investigating a range ofnew and developing technologies and methods for Environmental Impact Analysis.
              <br><br>
              Within this project, the University of Cambridge will work with the Universidad Nacional Aut6noma de Huanta (UNAH) to establish environmental research facilities and capabilities based at UNAH to promote long-term environmental research.
