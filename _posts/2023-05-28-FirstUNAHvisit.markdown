On 15th May three UNAH staff – Bio.Walter Castro Aponte, Ing.Juan Quispe Rodriguez and Ing.Santos Herrera Diaz arrived for a two week visit to the Dept.of Physics, in the Cavendish laboratory at Cambridge University.

## Bioacoustics & Biodiversity – field visit to Monks Wood, Woodwalton Fen & Ouse Washes
Demonstration of directional and omnidirectional microphone systems combined with use of digital recorders. 
A full morning was spent visiting Monks Wood and Woodwalton Fen national nature reserves to demonstrate the use of directional and omnidirectional microphone systems in combination with digital recorders. UNAH staff were required to deploy microphones in the vicinity of birdsong and record it. 

Visit to the Ouse Washes to discuss landscape change: the area has been completely reclaimed from the sea in medieval times; climate change: the area is very low lying and below sea-level in places so maintaining the complex drainage system is essential; and habitat restoration: to mitigate the impact of modern farming techniques employing extensive use of fertilisers and pesticides.
In the afternoon, a visit was made to the Trinity Science Park, on the outskirts of Cambridge, to demonstrate the connection between scientific research, technological advance and economic development. 

Subsequently, laboratory work demonstrated the use of Adobe audition to edit field recordings of birdsong. Additionally, the development of a sound library and sonographic database was described and demonstrated. 


## Nature’s microstructures
The UNAH visitors and P.Newton & E.Barnes from UCAM, used both optical microscopy (in the Wet lab.) and electron microscopy (in the Cavendish microscopy suite) to demonstrate the microscopic structures of butterfly wings to UNAH staff.
The use of a field-compatible optical microscope (dino-lite) was also demonstrated and the two varieties of scales on the wing of the morpho didius butterfly – the transparent scales can be seen to overlay the blue scales on the surface of the wing-  were explored. We then investigated these structures using electron microscopy (the Helios FIB/SEM), looking at the structures on the surface of both the transparent and apparently blue scales under high magnification. This allowed us to see the expected “Christmas tree” structure on the blue scales, clearly seeing features smaller than 100 nm. 
We also used a microtome to make a slice of a piece of butterfly wing which was then set in glue and studied this under the electron microscope. These sorts of imaging investigations are critical for understanding the photonic structures in butterfly wing scales and may lead to future developments in technology or environmental sensing.


## Sediment analysis 
Three researchers from the University of Huanta, Peru were trained over three days to obtain information from the major chemical elements contained in sediment from the river bed and banks of the rio Cachi and three of its tributaries: rio Opanaccay, Hunat and Huamanguilla-Iguian. The samples were collected during the field visit in March 2023.
On the first day, the visitors were introduced to the equipment in the Cavendish laboratory for analysing inorganic samples. It is important when using such sensitive equipment to place emphasis on the condition of the atmosphere and temperature of the samples.

On the second day, the researchers were introduced to the techniques for analysing the sediment samples. In Figure 2 (left photo) the researchers were introduced to analysing the iron/iron-oxide components in the sediment samples from their magnetic behaviour. Every training session was followed by discussions and questions to ensure the researchers had understood the explanations.

The third day was devoted to hands on activities in the lab. The researchers were trained in handling the samples, placing them in the sample holder and using the equipment. Figure 3 (top row photos) shows the research visitors preparing the samples and mounting them in the holder sample. Figure 3 (bottom row photos) shows the researchers training in using the equipment. The major chemical composition of the samples were obtained by energy dispersive X ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The results showed that the main elemental composition of the samples were Si, Al, Ca, Na and O, corresponding with deposits of aluminium-silicates which are typical of sediments and sands.


## Remote Sensing
On the first day, we looked at the UK drone pilot license requirements and drone mission planning. The visitors took the UK CAA theory exam and all successfully obtained their UK Drone Pilot licenses (see photo). We then talked about the extensive pre-planning that goes into preparing a drone mission – with respect to both the legal side and the logistics of flying over a region of interest.

On the second day, we looked at data post-processing. We looked at four common (free) softwares for data analysis:
1. WebODM was used to aggregate drone footage from a mission we had performed in Huanta, in March 2023. With all the images, we created an orthophoto (large map) that we were able to export to other software.
2. Google Earth Pro was used to investigate historical satellite data of the area (what the countryside and fields looked like 20 years ago).
3. QGIS was used to import the orthophoto we created using WebODM and used spectral band algebra to compile a vegetation index. We calculated and visualised the health of the plants on a tomato farm we had visited in March 2023. (See image).
4. Google Earth Engine was used to show how we can undertake more intensive investigations using satellite data. We looked at many different indices (vegetation, water, elevation, slope, hillshade) and we looked at an introduction to using statistical analysis to categorise different land types.
