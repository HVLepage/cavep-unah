On Tuesday 5th April, a small team from the University of Cambridge had the pleasure of making an initial visit to the University of Huanta, where we were received with great warmth and enthusiasm. The newly appointed mayor of Huanta in one of his first public acts, presented us with the ‘Civic medal’ of the city. We were then entertained by a group of traditional musicians and dancers before Dra. Delia Gamarra Gamarra officially welcomed us to the University of Huanta. A group of staff and students in local costumes then gave us a tour of the University and its facilities.
