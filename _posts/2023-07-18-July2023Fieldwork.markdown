## UCAM workshops

Two workshops were given by Dr. Luis De Los Santos Valladares during a visit to the National University of Huanta, in July 2023. The first one covered the preparation of risk assessments for all the laboratories and laboratory equipment and the second was about the collection and treatment of soil/sediment samples. 

## Risk assessment workshop

-Day 1: Dr. L.de Los Santos Valladares gave a talk about the definitions, importance and procedures for the preparation of risk assessments for the National University of Huanta. 

-Day 2: the workshop was devoted to preparing specific risk assessments for the laboratories and equipment in the laboratories of the National University of Huanta. A risk assessment format was presented by Dr. De Los Santos Valladares. The original file was left with the UNAH staff and students for future use.

Visits were then made to some of the UNAH laboratories with students and staff to fill out sample risk assessment forms. The formal risk assessment forms will be completed during the next few weeks by the UNAH staff in charge of each laboratory and the equipment in them. They will be presented in future reports.

## Collection and first treatment of soil/sediment samples workshop
A visit as made to the Huaper lake with UNAH staff and students to demonstrate the procedure for the collection of soil/sediment samples. Approximately 0.5kg of soil/sediment was collected from 17 points inside the perimeter of the lake impacted area by the students. The samples were collected by groups of four to five students and were coded. Some initial observations during the collection of the samples were prepared by the students while at the lake site.

The samples were taken to the laboratory of the National University of Huanta to receive their first treatment. In the laboratory, the samples were dried at 37 degrees Celcius to remove any organic matter and then inspected with an optical microscope.
