## UNAH UK visit – September 2023
On 12th September three UNAH staff – Dr Juvenal Castromonte Salinas, Ing.Tulio Paytan Montanez and Ing.Amlia Cardenas Bustamante arrived for a two week visit to the Dept.of Physics, in the Cavendish laboratory at the University of Cambridge. This was the second of several planned academic visits to be made by UNAH staff to UCAM.

## Bioacoustics & Biodiversity – field visit to Monks Wood, Woodwalton Fen & Ouse Washes with E.Barnes
This day was aimed at visiting two National Nature Reserves: Monks Wood and Woodwalton Fen, where environmental research is advancing rapidly. At both sites there are research centres where environmental investigations are being undertaken.

At Monks Wood investigations are looking into the impacts of climate change on vegetation dynamics, species diversity and the spread of disease in natural systems. In particular, investigations are looking at newly arrived insects from Europe, changes in species composition in avifauna and lepidoptera, and Ash die-back and its connection to climate change. 

One component of the UCAM agreement with UNAH involves the development and use of bioacoustics in environmental assessments. At Monks Wood NNR we looked at some of the equipment being used to develop these new methods for generating environmental data and making assessments of environmental quality and change. This included practising with directional and omnidirectional microphone systems in combination with digital recorders. UNAH staff were required to deploy microphones in the vicinity of birdsong and record it. 

At Woodwalton Fen NNR investigations are providing data demonstrating the importance of peatlands for carbon capture and water resource management. The concrete support posts of the research centre have marks which show the drop in soil level and a series of floods affecting the area since 1950. This Fen and many others in the area are part of the Great Fenland project. A project designed to restore a small area of the once vast Fenlands to contribute to mitigating the impacts of climate change and assist with the management of water resources.   

The Ouse Washes have been completely reclaimed from the sea since medieval times. The impact of agricultural practices on soil erosion, falling land levels and the loss of soil fertility - much of the Fens lie below sea-level - were clearly observed.

In the afternoon, a visit was made to the Trinity Science Park, on the outskirts of Cambridge, to demonstrate the connection between scientific research, technological advance and economic development.

Por la tarde, se visitó el Trinity Science Park, en las afueras de Cambridge, para demostrar la conexión entre investigación científica, avance tecnológico y desarrollo económico.
